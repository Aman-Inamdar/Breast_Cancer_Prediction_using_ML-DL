# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_using_ML-DL
<p>This project focuses on breast cancer prediction using machine learning applied to gene expression data. Key algorithms employed include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. The study involved preprocessing steps such as data normalization and feature selection to reduce dimensionality, followed by hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The Neural Network achieved an accuracy of 92%, while Random Forest and SVM attained accuracies of 89% and 87%, respectively. Evaluation metrics such as F1 score and precision further validated the robustness of the models. This research highlights the effectiveness of AI in improving diagnostic precision for breast cancer.</p>
